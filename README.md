# Flooded Areas AI

This repository contains the source code for my Master's Thesis titled "Assessment of neural networks for semantic segmentation of flooded areas".

In recent years, there has been an extraordinary development in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in machine learning and neural networks. Simultaneously, modern climate change, the intensification of extreme weather events, and the growing population living in vulnerable areas make the problem of floods increasingly relevant and in need of effective monitoring and management tools.

In the face of these challenges, it is crucial to develop technologies that enable efficient monitoring and analysis of flood-prone areas. One of the promising directions in this field is the use of artificial intelligence, especially neural networks, for the automatic identification of flooded areas. This allows for fast and precise detection and classification of vulnerable areas, which is key for decision-making during crisis situations.
