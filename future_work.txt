- implement transforms as callbacks to be configurable
- exception catcher? for common things like wrong input/traget size (train/val/test)
    - so exceptions aren't so scary
    - so the program can exit gracefully and save current progress (so you don't loose at least the results if it fails on eg. second to last epoch)
- add model base class
